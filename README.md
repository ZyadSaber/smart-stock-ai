## 🌟 Key Advantages

### ⚡ **Real-Time Data Synchronization**

Don't wait for refreshes. Stock levels, sales figures, and purchase orders are processed instantly using **Database Triggers**. Every sale automatically deducts from your specific warehouse inventory, and every purchase adds to it immediately.

### 🏭 **Multi-Warehouse Support**

Manage inventory across multiple locations effortlessly. Transfer stock between warehouses (`Stock Movements`), sell from specific locations, and track valuation per site.

### 💰 **Profit-First Logic**

Every transaction calculates profit in real-time. The system tracks your Cost Price vs. Selling Price per unit, giving you immediate insight into your `Gross Profit` on the dashboard.

### 🛡️ **Robust Validation & Safety**

Built-in safety checks prevent:

- ❌ Selling items that are out of stock.
- ❌ Negative inventory balances.
- ❌ Duplicate data entries.

## 🔄 Data Architecture & Flow

SmartStock AI uses a centralized **PostgreSQL** database where logic is enforced at the data layer for maximum reliability.

    subgraph Client Application
        UI[User Interface] -->|Action| SA[Server Actions]
        SA -->|Validation| Zod[Zod Schema]
    end

    subgraph Backend & Database
        Zod -->|Clean Data| DB[(Supabase DB)]

        %% Sales Flow
        DB -->|Insert Sale| T1[Trigger: Sale Items]
        T1 -->|Deduct Qty| Stock[Product Stocks Table]

        %% Purchase Flow
        DB -->|Insert Purchase| T2[Trigger: Purchase Items]
        T2 -->|Add Qty| Stock

        %% Movement Flow
        DB -->|Transfer| T3[Trigger: Stock Movement]
        T3 -->|Minus Source / Add Target| Stock
    end

    Stock -->|Real-time Update| UI
```

### **How it works:**

1.  **User Action**: A user submits a form (e.g., "New Sale").
2.  **Server Action**: Next.js receives the request and validates inputs using **Zod**.
3.  **Database Transaction**: The record is inserted into `sales` and `sale_items`.
4.  **Automatic Triggers**: PostgreSQL triggers (`decrease_stock_after_sale`) automatically fire, efficiently updating the `product_stocks` table without extra API calls.
5.  **Revalidation**: The UI automatically updates via `revalidatePath` to show the fresh data instantly.
